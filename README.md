# Focuscrack

Hello, this is my first solo project building a complete web application.

**Focuscrack** is a web app designed to help you focus on what you're doing.

>Focus is the key to unlocking your potential. A slowly hatching egg symbolizes the progress toward your goal. When the timer ends, you receive a collectible character randomly, building your own collection. 

All UI designs were created in `Figma`, and the app was developed entirely by myself using `React + Vite, and Tailwind CSS`.

This project represents my first step into building a complete web application independently.
